# Phishing Emails Detection Report

### Introduction
This study focuses on detecting phishing emails using advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques. The aim is to accurately predict and classify emails as 'Safe' or 'Phishing'.

### Dataset
The study utilizes the "Phishing Email Detection" dataset from Kaggle, ideal for text analytics in phishing email detection.

### Methodologies
#### 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- SVM's performance on balanced and imbalanced datasets was evaluated.

#### 2. K-Means Clustering
- Application of k-means clustering in categorizing emails.

#### 3. Logistic Regression
- Logistic regression for binary classification of emails.

#### 4. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- CNN's implementation for more complex text data classification.

### Results
- Logistic Regression and SVM achieved 97% accuracy.
- CNN slightly outperformed with 98% accuracy.
- K-Means Clustering showed limitations with 62% precision and recall.

### Conclusion
The study highlights the effectiveness and limitations of various machine learning techniques in phishing email detection. It contributes significantly to cybersecurity, particularly in identifying phishing attempts.
